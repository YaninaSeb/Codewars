// A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime numberâ€”for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term twin prime is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair. (from wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime)
// Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a function that counts the number of sets of twin primes from 1 to n.
// If n is wrapped by twin primes (n-1 == prime && n+1 == prime) then that should also count even though n+1 is outside the range.
// Ex n = 10
// Twin Primes are (3,5) (5,7) so your function should return 2!

function twinPrime(n) {

    let simpleNum = [];
    let res = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n+1; i++) {
        let count = 1;

        for (let k = 1; k <= i/2; k++) {
            if (i % k == 0) count++;
        }

        if (count == 2) simpleNum.push(i);
    }

    for (let j = 0; j < simpleNum.length - 1; j++) {
        if ((simpleNum[j+1] - simpleNum[j]) == 2) res++;
    }

    return res;
}
