// You are given two sorted lists, with distinct elements. Find the maximum 
// path sum while traversing through the lists.

// Points to consider for a valid path:
// - A path can start from either list, and can finish in either list.
// - If there is an element which is present in both lists (regardless of its 
// index in the lists), you can choose to change your path to the other list.

// Return only the maximum path sum.

// Example:
// [0, 2, 3, 7, 10, 12]
// [1, 5, 7, 8]

// Both lists having only 7 as common element, the possible paths would be:

// 0->2->3->7->10->12 => 34
// 0->2->3->7->8      => 20
// 1->5->7->8         => 21
// 1->5->7->10->12    => 35 (maximum path)

// Hence, the output will be 35 in the example above.

// Notes:
// - The arrays may contain no common terms.
// - The common element should only be counted once.
// - Aim for a linear time complexity.
// - Range of possible inputs:  0 <=len(l1), len(l2) <= 125000

function maxSumPath(l1,l2){
    // Your code here
}

console.log(maxSumPath([2, 3, 7, 10, 12],[1, 5, 7, 8])) //35
